> A simple Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol by which clients can communicate with each other.   

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/carissaallen/irc.svg?token=mazRg9fgNkq1HJ56kVyT&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/carissaallen/irc)

This communication system employs a central server which _relays_ messages to other connected users. Users can join rooms, which are groups of users that are subscribed to the same message stream. Any message sent to that room is forwarded to all users currently joined to that room.

Users can also send private messages directly to other users.
